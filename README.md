# barebones

A lightweight, skinny skeletal WordPress theme for HTML5 and beyond. Great as a starting point for any project with powerful features to encourage rapid development for most projects.

## Features

* Base reset and normalisation styles
* Includes Google HTML5 shiv
* Semantic use of HTML5 elements
* WAI-ARIA role ready
* Proprietary baseline and horizontal 960 responsive grid
* Comes pre-bundled with latest CDN version of jQuery and fallback
* index.php Loop template
* Customised functions.php adding theme support for high customisation

## Preprocessors

barebones doesn't come bundled with any CSS preprocessor files however the main stylesheet was compiled from SASS. To use a preprocessor, just add another folder containing your files into the ./_ directory and set your files to compile to ./style.css

## Browser Support

The basic features are all supported from IE6+. Yet to be tested in any other browsers than modern Mozilla, Opera and WebKit builds but confident it would work in legacy versions.
