# barebones

A lightweight and skeletal WordPress boilerplate theme for HTML5 and beyond. Great as a starting point with powerful features to encourage rapid development for most projects.

## Features

* Reset, normalisation and base font/form styles
* Adaptive at certain breakpoints and responsive through the middle
* Sass powered - semantically named files all compiled into a single file
* Semantic use of HTML5 elements, includes Google HTML5 shiv and respond.js for IE8 Media Queries
* WAI-ARIA role ready
* Proprietary baseline and customisable, Sass generated horizontal grid
* Comes pre-bundled with latest CDN version of jQuery and fallback
* index.php Loop template
* Customised functions.php adding theme support for high customisation
* Minimised HTTP requests for high Web Performance

## WordPress Support

Compatible with WordPress 3.2 and above.

## Browser Support

The basic features are all tested from IE7+. Yet to be tested in any other browsers than modern Mozilla, Opera and WebKit builds. Also tested on Safari and Chrome on iOS 5+ and Chrome on Android 3+.

## Preprocessors

Although barebones now utilises the powerful Sass CSS preprocessor, you don't have to use it. The main style.css file is not compressed so can be easily changed in a Text Editor.
